    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my website.</p>
    <h2>Please be patient as I learn the intricacies of html</h2>
    <p>Some people would have me believe that html is obsolete and I should simply 
       start paying AI or experts to build a website for me.  That may lead to a prettier package
      but I can only take pretty so far.  I'm doing this myself at least for right now. It's important
      that I at least learn a few of the basics myself.  Who knows what the future might hold.</p>
